# blog_exercise
My first exercise that is from Python Crash Course 2nd edition (Eric Matthes). It has the app named "blogs" that you can sign up and create your own whatever topic blog. In the blog, you can design what you want to do, such as challenge tracking, daily diary, what to do in each day, and much much more.
